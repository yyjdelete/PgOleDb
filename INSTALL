This is Win32 only project, meant to be compiled with Visual Studio. However, it does require
a little more than just double clicking the dsw file and choosing "compile" to set up.

The project itself no longer carries the header files for libpq. In order to compile this
project, you will first need to compile pqlib as a native Win32 DLL.

Libpq is part of the PostgreSQL sources. The instructions for compiling libpq for Windows
are available in the documentation for PostgreSQL. This driver requires, at the very least,
the libpq that came with PostgreSQL 7.4. Just download the sources and extract the archive
anywhere on your disk. Then follow the instructions in the manual. For 7.4, these can be
found at:
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.4/static/install-win32.html
Instructions for the latest version can usually be found at:
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/install-win32.html

After you have compiled libpq, you need to copy the generated libpq.dll file to your
system directory.

In addition to the above, the project file for PGOle searches for certain libraries
and include files under the postgresql source tree. In order to find it, you must set up
an environemnt variable called "PSQLSRC" to point to the root of the tree. This can usually
be achived by right clicking "My Computer" and changing the "Environemnt Settings".

Once these initial steps have been carried out, you can compile the PGOle project as usual.
If you are not a local Administrator you will need to register the resulting DLL with
regsvr32 running as Administrator. If your local user is a member of the Administrators
group, the registration takes place as part of the build process.

Distributing the resulting DLL requires PGOle.dll and libpq.dll. You will need to run
"regsvr32 PGOle.dll" on each machine where the provider needs to be installed.
