This is the OLE DB provider for PostgreSQL.
It is still a work in progress, and many things still don't work.

for more information.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
In order to install this software, copy PGOLEDB.DLL and LIBPQ.DLL into your system
directory. Next, as administrator, run "regsvr32 PGOLEDB.DLL". You should get a dialog
message saying "registration succeeded".

USAGE
In order to direct use to this provider, you must specify "PostgreSQL", "PostgreSQL.1" or
"PostgreSQL OLE DB Provider" as your "provider".

PgOleDb supports the following connection attributes:
Provider - mandatory. Must be set to "PostgreSQL", "PostgreSQL.1" or "PostgreSQL OLE DB Provider"
Data Source - server name or address
location - database name
User ID - PG user name to log in as 
password - the password
timeout - how long to wait when establishing the initial connection

COMPATIBILITY
At present, PgOleDb requires a PQLib of version 7.4 or up. It also requires a backend of
version 7.4 or up. Timestamps are only guarenteed to work with backends of version 8.0 and
above.

Attempting to connect to a database running version 7.3.x or down will result in an error
message saying "Couldn't query pg_type".

EXTENDED LOGGING
If anything goes wrong, extended logging can be turned on for the provider. To turn on extended
logging, modify in the registry the key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\PostgreSQL\OLE DB Provider
Under that key, create to values. One should be called "LogFile", and should specify full path
(directory + filename) of the log file to create. The second should be "LogLevel" (type DWORD),
and should specify what level of verbosity the logs should have. Setting it to "3" should give
fairly complete coverage.

When logging is no longer desired, please make sure to either remove or empty the "LogFile" value.
Failing to do so may result in unnecessary disk space wasted.
