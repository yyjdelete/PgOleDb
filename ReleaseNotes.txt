Notes:

The "OpenRowset" implementation is completely untested. As ADO doesn't call OpenRowset,
this won't affect too many people.

The exact same goes to "GetSchemas" implementation.

The "time", "timestamp" and "timestamptz" types depend on the way the server was compiled.
PgOleDb can support one or the other representation, but not both. As a result, these types
may return illegal or incorrect values when certain servers are queried.

New to version 1.0.0.18:
- Lots of new types supported. Currently supported types are:
	bool, name, int8, int2, int4, text, oid, xid, float4, float8, unknown, money, text[],
	bpchar, varchar, date, time, timestamp, timestamptz and numeric, as well as non-builtin
	types varcharci and utinyint.


New to Version 1.0.0.17:
- Schema support. Only "TABLES" at this point.

New to Version 1.0.0.16:
- Greatly improve the error reporting
- Fix the "no error checking on IID_NULL" bug.
